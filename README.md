# PAP-L1-Python-Final-Project-v1
---
Students create a Python coded game that can be viewed and played in the browser.\
To create their games, students use the Python they've learned so far, plus custom, pre-built functions.

**Students type their Python code in the file:  game.html**

Students can add images, but **should not edit** any other file or outside the designated area in game.html

## Game Engine

This project is built with Skulpt.\
Skulpt converts Python into Javascript.\
